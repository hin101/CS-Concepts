Linked Lists
============
A linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes.

Types of Linked List
--------------------
There are two main types of linked lists:
* Singly Linked List - each node points to the next node in the linked list.
* Doubly Linked List - each node points to both the next node and the previous node.
