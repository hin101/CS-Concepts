Queue
=====
A queue implements FIFO(first-in first-out) ordering.

Queues are often used in breadth-first searching or in implementing a cache.

Queue Operations
----------------
A queue uses the following operations:
* `add(val)`: Add an item at the end of the list.
* `remove`: Remove the first item in the list.
* `peek`: Return the top of the queue.
* `empty?`: Returns true if the queue is empty
