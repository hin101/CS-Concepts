Binary Search
=============
## In-Order Traversal
In-order traversal means to print the left branch, then the current node, and finally the right node.

When performed on a binary search tree, it visits the nodes in ascending order.

## Pre-Order Traversal
Pre-order traversal prints the current node before its child nodes. The root is always the first node that is printed.

## Post-Order Traversal
Post-order traversal prints the current node after its child nodes. The root node is always the last node that is printed.
